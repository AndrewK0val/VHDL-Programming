# Embedded Systems Architecture and Hardware

In this repository, I am learning VHDL for the module: Embedded Systems Architecture and Hardware. I am using the program: ModelSim to simulate and compile VHDL code.  

I thought it would be worth mentioning that ModelSim is officially supported for Windows and Linux, however I was able to emulate the windows version successfully on my apple silicon Mac using Wine.

I am using neovim as my text editor along with the vhdl_ls language server to write the code.
